		<h1>I know why the caged bird sings</h1>
		<h3>Maya Angelou</h3>
		<p>
		A <br>free <br>bird leaps <br>on the back <br>Of the wind and <br>floats downstream Till the current <br>ends and dips his wing In <br>the orange suns rays And dares to <br>claim the sky. But a BIRD that stalks <br>down his narrow cage Can seldom see through his <br>bars of rage His wings are clipped and his feet <br>are tied So he opens his throat to sing. The caged <br>bird sings with a fearful trill Of things unknown but longed for <br>still And his tune is heard on the distant hill for The caged <br>bird sings of freedom. The free bird thinks of another breeze And the trade <br>winds soft through The sighing trees And the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright <br>Lawn and he names the sky his own. But a caged BIRD stands on the grave <br>of dreams His shadow shouts on a nightmare scream His wings are clipped and his feet are <br>tied So he opens his throat to sing. The caged bird sings with A fearful trill of things <br>unknown But longed for still and his Tune is heard on the distant hill For the caged bird sings of <br>f<br>r<br>e<br>e<br>d<br>o<br>m<br>.
