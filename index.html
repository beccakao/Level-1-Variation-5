		<h1>I know why the caged bird sings</h1>
		<h3>Maya Angelou</h3>
		<p>
		A <br>free <br>bird <br>leaps on <br>the back Of <br>the wind and <br>floats downstream Till <br>the current ends and <br>dips his wing In <br>the orange suns rays <br>And dares to claim the sky. <br>But a BIRD that stalks down <br>his narrow cage Can seldom see <br>through his bars of rage His <br>wings are clipped and his feet <br>are tied So he opens his throat <br>to sing. The caged bird sings with <br>a fearful trill Of things unknown but longed <br>for still And his tune is heard on <br>the distant hill for The caged bird <br>sings of freedom. The free bird thinks <br>of another breeze And the trade winds <br>soft through The sighing trees And <br>the fat worms waiting on a <br>dawn-bright Lawn and he names <br>the sky his own. But <br>a caged BIRD stands on <br>the grave of dreams His <br>shadow shouts on a nightmare <br>scream His wings are <br>clipped and his feet <br>are tied So he <br>opens his throat to <br>sing. The caged <br>bird sings with <br>A fearful trill of <br>things unknown But <br>longed for still <br>and his Tune <br>is heard on <br>the distant <br>hill For <br>the caged <br>bird sings <br>of f<br>r<br>e<br>e<br>d<br>o<br>m<br>.
